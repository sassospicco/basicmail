BasicMail 0.1, a simple message exchange suite.

Usage: basicmail <server|client> [OPTIONS]

Options:

	Server:
		-p,	Listening port, default is 7575
	
	Client:
		-s,	Server IP address, default is 127.0.0.1
		-h,	Server hostname, e.g. example.com
		-p, Server port, default is 7575
		
		-s and -h parameters are obviously conflicting, last one will take precedence.

Configuration:

	A little bit of configuration is required, but server-side only.
	Namely, you need to create ~/.basicmail/cfg/users file and populate it with your users' names and passwords.
	The users file is in tab-separated-values format with only two columns: username and password.
	Valid usernames characters are in the class [0-9a-z]; valid password characters are in the class
	[0-9A-Za-z ].
	A limit is enforced: each field must be up to 20 characters long; otherwise, the offensing line will not
	be parsed correctly (the fields may be truncated or the line may be skipped altogether), but other lines
	will not be affected.
	Line starting with # are comments.
	Please note: a trailing newline is required after last uncommented line, otherwise it will be ignored.
